    <th width="50%">Hi, my name is Holger.<br><br>
    I have been working with Cloud Infrastructure for the last few years, so I thought I could as well write down some of the things I find useful or interesting. You will not only find Cloudy stuff on this page, but also personal projects or anything else that I want to share with the world<br><br>
    My work experience ranges from about working on Open Source C++ Projects, creating support tools for engineers, building Cloud Infrastructure to building Public Clouds, but mostly its building Cloud Infrastructure to support development teams that keeps me going.
